# sELDIG_extinction_estimate
Estimating extinction (and other rates) estimates from simulation trees

# Data
We will use phylogenetic trees generated from Oskar's simulations

# Models for estimating extinction rate
We will try several methods that are currently widely used:
  * BAMM by Dan Rabosky (http://bamm-project.org)
  * RPANDA by Hélène Morlon (https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12526)
  * Oskar and Loïc suggested something by Tanja Stadler 
  * A very recent model(?) by Stilianos Louca & Matthew W. Pennell (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2176-1)
